Project Purpose:

We are porting the iProlog code into a C++ Verison.

The goal is to correctly port iProlog to be runned using GCC.
We want to be able run prolog code using C++ engine.


Currently main code is the main.cpp to run the code yo can just
c++ compiler to compile the main.cpp

Current Progress:

IntList: Done

IntStack: Done

IntMap: Done

Clause: Done

Spline: Done

IMap: Need to Work On (Mid) Done

Toks: Need to Work On (Hardish/ more tedious) 11/11

Need to write it from scratch. 

Engine: Need to Work On (Need to finish other first) 11/25

Need to determine LinkedHashMap function in c++

Prog: Need to Work On (Need to finish the other first) 11/25

Do not need 40% of the code. Splitolater/customer/streamsupport removed

ObStack: Done (Vector provide all the functions ie pop_back/push_back/back)


Current Task:
Toks files. So we can work on Engine/Prog.

Work Order:
Toks -> Engine -> Prog -> Add in all the outputting data. 

~1350 Lines left to translate

Toks File: Just use a istringstream or boost::Tokenizer. no need for MakeTok/Tok/.../ 

Just need the toSentence function and the keyword denoted. for engine to work
